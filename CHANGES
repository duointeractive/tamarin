Changes
=======

1.2
---
* If we run across a log entry that we can't parse, simply log as an error
  and continue to the next line instead of stopping and failing. The parser is
  good enough now that I don't have mis-givings about doing this now.

1.1
---
* Allow blank double-quoted User-Agent strings. This is exceedingly rare so far,
  but it does look like it happens once in a blue moon.
* Add this CHANGES file.

1.0
----
* Initial release.
